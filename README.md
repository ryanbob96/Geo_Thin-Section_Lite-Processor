# Geo_Thin-Section_Lite-Processor
SPE GeoHackaton 2022 Challenge: Image Processing of BSE-CL-MM Thin Section 

We understand that there are two main elements for processing the microscope image based on Machine Learning – Deep Learning: Shape & Color. When we talk about the data related to shape, we will mostly discuss how we define edges during the processing or data input (for Deep Learning). But here, as we prefer to bring a "Lite" and "Fast" version of BSE – CL microscope image processing, we prefer to play with Value colors.
